Hi, 

After doing the npm install, and hitting localhost:3000. You will see two radio button on top to select the problem 1 (mentioned below) or problem 2. Once after selecting the problem different form are going to appear dynamically with instruction on how the input data should look like. Once you enter the data and hit submit, you should be able to see the output for home assignment in output form and for second problem you need to check the console for the output. 

Here I have provided some screenshots from my testing:
Problem 1: Create a React app with two text areas and a "submit" button. Users are expected to enter a comma separated list of strings in each text box. Clicking the "submit" button will parse each text area splitting by commas. It will print out the list of strings in the left text box that are not present in the right text box.

Problem 2: Flaten a nested object
